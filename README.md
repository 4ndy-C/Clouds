# DISCLAIMER 
Most of the code here is not my work. The orginial author is Sebastion Lague.

The purpose of this is to serve as a comparison during the evaluation of my prototype. 

What have i changed: 
1. removed the plane flight in flight demo so i can focus on the cloud
2. added a flycam to take a close look at the clouds (not my best work)
